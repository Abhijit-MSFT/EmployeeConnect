We simply match what we see around us to what we see on our GPS devices to determine where we are and where we need to go. Driverless cars, however, struggle with this basic reasoning. In every new area, the cars must first map and analyze all the new roads, which is very time consuming.

A new report commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) has found that over the next five years, more than 77% of jobs in the country’s mining sector will be altered by technological innovations, increasing productivity by up to 23%.According to MCA’s CEO Tania Constable, Australia’s education and training system will require the greatest transformation. She anticipates the modernised structure to offer “enhanced movement between universities and the vocational education sectors”, combining traditional mining skills with ‘the latest scientific, technical and trade skills’ such as data analytics, computing and change management.Future degrees are also expected to focus on collaboration, creativity, and social science skills in response to ‘changing community expectations’, offering student’s higher certifications and fit-for-purpose degrees.Current exploration design is hindered by the fact that it is based on retrospective and static methods, with only minimal adjustments possible during drilling. However, new technologies such as geo-spatial data, 3D mapping and hyperspectral core imaging allow the material drilled to be continuously monitored, while tools such as autonomous drills allow exploration methods to be adapted in response to information gathered. Companies already employing such technology include Rio Tinto and BHP, the former with its 3D mapping technology and the latter with its downhole assay.Rio Tinto’s system comes under its Mine of the Future programme, and works to identify the size, location and quality of underground deposits in real-time, accessing data from automated trucks and drills on the site. BHP’s downhole assay, deployed at their Pilbara operations, works to distinguish between resources and waste material, and is anticipated to save the firm more than $10m on drilling and assay costs at sites in Western Australia.",

Deployed in early 2018, the system is now being widely used by Google and other tech firms.The paper now demonstrates for other researchers in the field how automated methods can be implemented to prevent human-made errors in generating cryptocode, and how key adjustments to components of the system can help achieve higher performance.To secure online communications, cryptographic protocols run complex mathematical algorithms that do some complex arithmetic on large numbers. Behind the scenes, however, a small group of experts write and rewrite those algorithms by hand. For each algorithm, they must weigh various mathematical techniques and chip architectures to optimize for performance. When the underlying math or architecture changes, they essentially start over from scratch. Apart from being or-intensive, this manual process can produce nonoptimal algorithms and often introduces bugs that are later caught and fixed.Researchers from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) instead designed “Fiat Cryptography,” a system that automatically generates — and simultaneously verifies — optimized cryptographic algorithms for all hardware platforms. In tests, the researchers found their system can generate algorithms that match performance of the best handwritten code, but much faster.",

In robots, this connection doesn’t exist. In an effort to bridge the gap, researchers developed a predictive AI capable of learning to “see by touching” and “feel by seeing,” a means of linking senses of sight and touch in future robots.Using a KUKA robot arm with a tactile sensor called GelSight (another MIT creation), the team recorded nearly 200 objects with a web cam. These included tools, fabrics, household products and other every day materials humans come into contact with regularly.The team used the robotic arm to touch the items more than 12,000 times, breaking each of these video clips into static frames for further analysis. All told, researchers ended up with more than three million visual/tactile paired imgs in its dataset.“By looking at the scene, our model can imagine the feeling of touching a flat surface or a sharp edge,” said Yunzhu Li, CSAIL PhD student and lead author on a new paper about the system. “By blindly touching around, our model can predict the interaction with the environment purely from tactile feelings.”For humans, this comes naturally. We can touch an item once, even years prior, and have a sense of how it feels when we come into contact with it at a later date. In robots, it could help to reduce human input for mechanical tasks, such as flipping a switch, or deciding where the safest place to pick up a package is.",

One major concern: Most AI software is designed and tested in one hospital, and it risks faltering when transferred to another.Last month in the Journal of the American College of Radiology, U.S. government scientists, regulators, and doctors published a road map describing how to convert research-based AI into improved medical imaging on patients. Among other things, the authors urged more collaboration across disciplines in building and testing AI algorithms, and intensive validation of algorithms beforey reach patients. For now, Hsiao says, “I would want a human physician no matter what,” even if a machine hums alongside.Most AI in medicine is used in research, but regulators have already approved some algorithms for radiologists. Physicians are also developing their own—which they’re permitted to use without regulatory approval as long as companies aren’t marketing the new technology.

However, when German-American psychologist Herbert Freudenberger first recognised the problem of burnout in New York City in 1974, at a clinic for addicts and homeless people, Freudenberger wasn’t thinking of drug users.The clinic’s volunteers were actually struggling, too: their work was intense, and many were beginning to feel demotivated and emotionally drained. Though they had once found their jobs rewarding, they had become cynical and depressed; they weren’t giving their patients the attention they deserved. Freudenberger defined this alarming new condition as a state of exhaustion caused by prolonged overwork – and borrowed the term ‘burnout’ to describe it.  ",

We simply match what we see around us to what we see on our GPS devices to determine where we are and where we need to go. Driverless cars, however, struggle with this basic reasoning. In every new area, the cars must first map and analyze all the new roads, which is very time consuming.

A new report commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) has found that over the next five years, more than 77% of jobs in the country’s mining sector will be altered by technological innovations, increasing productivity by up to 23%.According to MCA’s CEO Tania Constable, Australia’s education and training system will require the greatest transformation. She anticipates the modernised structure to offer “enhanced movement between universities and the vocational education sectors”, combining traditional mining skills with ‘the latest scientific, technical and trade skills’ such as data analytics, computing and change management.Future degrees are also expected to focus on collaboration, creativity, and social science skills in response to ‘changing community expectations’, offering student’s higher certifications and fit-for-purpose degrees.Current exploration design is hindered by the fact that it is based on retrospective and static methods, with only minimal adjustments possible during drilling. However, new technologies such as geo-spatial data, 3D mapping and hyperspectral core imaging allow the material drilled to be continuously monitored, while tools such as autonomous drills allow exploration methods to be adapted in response to information gathered. Companies already employing such technology include Rio Tinto and BHP, the former with its 3D mapping technology and the latter with its downhole assay.Rio Tinto’s system comes under its Mine of the Future programme, and works to identify the size, location and quality of underground deposits in real-time, accessing data from automated trucks and drills on the site. BHP’s downhole assay, deployed at their Pilbara operations, works to distinguish between resources and waste material, and is anticipated to save the firm more than $10m on drilling and assay costs at sites in Western Australia.",

Deployed in early 2018, the system is now being widely used by Google and other tech firms.The paper now demonstrates for other researchers in the field how automated methods can be implemented to prevent human-made errors in generating cryptocode, and how key adjustments to components of the system can help achieve higher performance.To secure online communications, cryptographic protocols run complex mathematical algorithms that do some complex arithmetic on large numbers. Behind the scenes, however, a small group of experts write and rewrite those algorithms by hand. For each algorithm, they must weigh various mathematical techniques and chip architectures to optimize for performance. When the underlying math or architecture changes, they essentially start over from scratch. Apart from being or-intensive, this manual process can produce nonoptimal algorithms and often introduces bugs that are later caught and fixed.Researchers from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) instead designed “Fiat Cryptography,” a system that automatically generates — and simultaneously verifies — optimized cryptographic algorithms for all hardware platforms. In tests, the researchers found their system can generate algorithms that match performance of the best handwritten code, but much faster.",

      "detailedNews": "Ryan Schellack:\tSo today we're announcing that the Lightning Web Components framework is open source. Specifically what that means is that the same framework that Salesforce uses, and Salesforce customers use, to build web components on the Salesforce platform for their applications and their services is now open source for anyone to use to build on any platform, using those same web standards, and the same beta web components that we provide for theoretically any application that they may want to build.That's what we're announcing today, and the reason it's significant for us is that this allows us to now build, for the first time, a community around our front-end framework, and around these JavaScript standards, and these web standards that we've innovated around.Over the past really two years, largely unknown to anyone, we've been working on this, but now we're able to bring these innovations to a broader community of trailblazers and developers that we work with on a daily basis, who want to take this and customize it, they want to iterate upon it and bring to it their experience. So what we've basically provided is a JavaScript framework that is open source, and really built around the enterprise developer experience, which is a voice that is near and dear to us, but one that we didn't feel was really well reflected within the array of frameworks currently provided today.There are two big goals around this thing—there's a lot of things that we'd love to choose, but two things are really important to us. One is that we wanted to build a JavaScript framework that the enterprise could rely on, not just for Salesforce-specific applications, but for any applications, and really that's because we felt that that's a very important segment that's underserved. They have specific requirements, such as the ability to run across many different browsers and to do so reliably. So we've introduced capabilities within this Lightning Web Components framework that's now open source that allow you to do that, not just create a really great application for something like Chrome, but also for Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11), which is a reality that many enterprise developers have to deal with, and that not every framework reflects and understands. That was a huge goal.",

      "detailedNews": "MIT researchers at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) have created a predictive AI that allows robots to link multiple senses in much the same way humans do.“While our sense of touch gives us a channel to feel the physical world, our eyes help us immediately understand the full picture of these tactile signals,” writes Rachel Gordon, of MIT CSAIL. In robots, this connection doesn’t exist. In an effort to bridge the gap, researchers developed a predictive AI capable of learning to “see by touching” and “feel by seeing,” a means of linking senses of sight and touch in future robots.Using a KUKA robot arm with a tactile sensor called GelSight (another MIT creation), the team recorded nearly 200 objects with a web cam. These included tools, fabrics, household products and other every day materials humans come into contact with regularly.The team used the robotic arm to touch the items more than 12,000 times, breaking each of these video clips into static frames for further analysis. All told, researchers ended up with more than three million visual/tactile paired imgs in its dataset.“By looking at the scene, our model can imagine the feeling of touching a flat surface or a sharp edge,” said Yunzhu Li, CSAIL PhD student and lead author on a new paper about the system. “By blindly touching around, our model can predict the interaction with the environment purely from tactile feelings.”For humans, this comes naturally. We can touch an item once, even years prior, and have a sense of how it feels when we come into contact with it at a later date. In robots, it could help to reduce human input for mechanical tasks, such as flipping a switch, or deciding where the safest place to pick up a package is.",

This card supports either the same 10 100GB Ethernet ports or 20 ports of 50GB Ethernet. The company is also launching a system with eight of these mezzanine cards.Last year, Habana Labs previously launched its Goya inferencing solution. With Gaudi, it now offers a complete solution for businesses that want to use its hardware over GPUs with chips from the likes of Nvidia. Thanks to its specialized hardware, Gaudi easily beats an Nvidia T4 accelerator on most standard benchmarks — all while using less power.",

      "detailedNews": "Standing in a wood-paneled room at the University of Oxford, surrounded by her artwork, Ai-Da looks out at her creations. “I want people to know that our times are powerful times,” she says slowly, pausing between sentences. Like many artists, she wants her work to promote discussion. And yet unlike other artists, Ai-Da tells us with a blank expression and glassy eyes that only blink occasionally, she does not have consciousness, thoughts and feelings. At least, not yet.Ai-Da’s creators bill her as the world’s first robot artist, and she’s the latest AI innovation to blur the boundary between machine and artist; a vision of the future suddenly becoming part of our present. She has a robotic arm system and human-like features, is equipped with facial recognition technology and is powered with artificial intelligence. She is able to analyze an image in front of her, which feeds into an algorithm to dictate the movement of her arm, enabling her to produce sketches. Her goal is creativity.She is currently on dislay at Oxford in what organizers say is the world’s first exhibition to show the solo work of a robotic artist. Using academic Margaret Boden’s philosophical definition of creativity as something that is new, surprising and of value, art dealer and leader of the Ai-Da project Aidan Meller believes Ai-Da’s output meets these criteria. He tells TIME that each of the robot’s creations are different every time, even with the same stimulus, and are unreproducible.",

      "detailedNews": "Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is the most trusted source of Apple rumors — once predicting that the company would sell three different iPhones well over a year before that came true. Now, he’s betting that we’ll see the first 5G iPhones in 2020, despite the fact that Apple’s original 5G modem supplier is no longer making them anymore (via MacRumors and 9to5Mac).You see, we’d already heard that Apple might have a 5G iPhone by 2020, but it was slated to use an Intel radio chip — something which we’ve since learned won’t be happening, because Apple chose to go with Qualcomm instead, forcing Intel to close up its 5G modem shop. That came at a great cost: Apple agreed to settle all its pending lawsuits with Qualcomm and spent at least $4.5 billion to secure the chipmaker’s cooperation, for the sake of the iPhone’s future. The shuffle left us with some big questions, including when we might see the first 5G iPhone now that Apple has to scramble to swap out its Intel radios.If Kuo’s right, the answer is: “Right on schedule.” Both a new, smaller 5.4-inch iPhone and a even larger 6.7-inch one will have 5G support in 2020, according to Kuo’s prediction. (Sounds like the XS is getting smaller and the Max is getting bigger, based on those screen sizes.) And he says all three of Apple’s 2020 iPhones — including a low-cost 6.1-inch iPhone XR successor that’ll stay on LTE for now — will feature the vibrant colors and inky blacks of OLED screens, as opposed to the cheaper LCD panel you see in today’s XR and that will reportedly stick around for the 2019 model.That means every iPhone will theoretically have an OLED panel in 2020. Kuo expects all of them will have 5G support in 2021, with Apple having the opportunity to switch from Qualcomm radios to its own in-house modems in 2022 or 2023.",

However, when German-American psychologist Herbert Freudenberger first recognised the problem of burnout in New York City in 1974, at a clinic for addicts and homeless people, Freudenberger wasn’t thinking of drug users.The clinic’s volunteers were actually struggling, too: their work was intense, and many were beginning to feel demotivated and emotionally drained. Though they had once found their jobs rewarding, they had become cynical and depressed; they weren’t giving their patients the attention they deserved. Freudenberger defined this alarming new condition as a state of exhaustion caused by prolonged overwork – and borrowed the term ‘burnout’ to describe it.  ",
