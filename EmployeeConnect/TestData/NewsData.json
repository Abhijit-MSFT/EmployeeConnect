Human drivers are exceptionally good at navigating roads they haven't driven on before, using observation and simple tools. We simply match what we see around us to what we see on our GPS devices to determine where we are and where we need to go. Driverless cars, however, struggle with this basic reasoning. In every new area, the cars must first map and analyze all the new roads, which is very time consuming.

Manley, who’s been CEO less than a year, sold 250,000 shares at an average price of $13.85, according to a Tuesday filing with the Dutch market regulator AFM. Automotive News reported the filing earlier.Manley, 55, sold the stock to cover personal expenses, Niel Golightly, a Fiat Chrysler spokesman, said by phone. The CEO held off carrying out the transaction until after Monday’s announcement of the Renault merger offer to avoid violating insider-trading restrictions, the spokesman said. Under the terms of Fiat Chrysler’s proposed merger, Manley would be replaced as CEO by Renault’s Jean-Dominiq, who’s been chairman since January. The Financial Times has reported Manley would be chief operating officer. Renault’s board is expected to give preliminary approval to the proposal as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter have said. The transaction would be structured as a 50-50 owned Netherlands-based company, with Renault shareholders -- including the French government -- getting an implied premium of about 10%.",

Where multiple copies survived, the best were used for the digital versions, but no attempt was made to digitally fill damage.

She could start with US author Hubert Selby Jr’s classic 1978 novel Requiem for a Dream, suggests ‘bibliotherapist’ Ella Berthoud. The tale of four people struggling with different forms of drug addiction, later adapted into a movie at the turn of millennium, may admittedly be “pretty grim, but I think she’ll relate to it,” says Berthoud. “The overall message of the book is to try and stick to your principles, and seize the day once more, so hopefully she’ll read it and feel purged and renewed.”So how can books re-balance the self? Well, above all, as the panel agreed, they provide a form of escapism that is more intense than in any other artform. “With a film or TV show, you’re given the visuals whereas with a novel you’re inventing them yourself, so it’s actually much more of a powerful event, because you’re involved,” as Berthoud noted.",

Built on a hill overlooking the city and surrounding countryside, La Rotonda was a freestanding villa independent of agriculture, religion or commerce. A place of study, contemplation and quiet enjoyment, it was also a work of impeccable art.Neither patron nor architect lived to see La Rotonda completed. Here, though, a thing of beauty was indeed a joy forever. Serene, symmetrical, laced with subtle religious symbolism – its plan a cross set within a square within an imaginary circle – and with classical Ionic porticos facing all four cardinal points of the compass, this exquisite house connected landscape to city while fusing art to architecture.

Despite being the signatory to the Montreal Protocol, and agreeing to phase out production of CFC-11 in 2010, China continued to emit the polluting gas.A study released in May 2018 found that emissions of CFC-11 were on the rise since 2013. In fact, the emissions increased by 25 per cent since 2012. Between 2008 and 2012, eastern China emitted an average of about 6,400 metric tonnes of CFC-11 per year. That number increased to about 13,400 metric tonnes per year from 2014 to 2017.Since 2013, about 7,000 more metric tonnes of the banned CFC-11 has been emitted each year from eastern China. This increase was traced to China’s Shandong and Hebei provinces — which account for at least 40 to 60 per cent of the global increase last year.“It is vital that we find out which activities and industries are responsible for the new emissions. If the emissions are due to the manufacture and use of products such as foams, it’s possible that we’ve seen only a small part of the total amount of CFC-11 that was recently produced,” said lead author, Matt Rigby, from the University of Bristol.China has the world’s largest polyurethane foam market, accounting for about 40 per cent of the world’s consumption. According to UK-based non-profit, Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), the Chinese foam manufacturers have been using CFC-11 illegally to save on the higher cost of alternatives, such as hydrochloro-fluorocarbons like HCFC-141b, which is to be phased out in China by 2026.The hole in the ozone is on the path to recovery according to the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO's) assessment; and reduction in the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s.",

      "detailedNews": "Traces of salt trapped in many diamonds show the stones are formed from ancient seabeds that became buried deep beneath the Earth's crust, according to new research led by Macquarie University geoscientists in Sydney, Australia.Most diamonds found at the Earth's surface are formed this way; others are created by crystallization of melts deep in the mantle.In experiments recreating the extreme pressures and temperatures found 200 kilometres underground, Dr Michael Förster, Professor Stephen Foley, Dr Olivier Alard, and colleagues at Goethe Universität and Johannes Gutenberg Universität in Germany, have demonstrated that seawater in sediment from the bottom of the ocean reacts in the right way to produce the balance of salts found in diamond.Diamonds are crystals of carbon that form beneath the Earth's crust in very old parts of the mantle. They are brought to the surface in volcanic eruptions of a special kind of magma called kimberlite.While gem diamonds are usually made of pure carbon, so-called fibrous diamonds, which are cloudy and less appealing to jewellers, often include small traces of sodium, potassium and other minerals that reveal information about the environment where they formed.These fibrous diamonds are commonly ground down and used in technical applications like drill bits.Fibrous diamonds grow more quickly than gem diamonds, which means they trap tiny samples of fluids around them while they form.",

      "detailedNews": "More than a quarter of people who regularly meditate have had a 'particularly unpleasant' psychological experience related to the practice, including feelings of fear and distorted emotions, a UCL-led study has found.The research, published in PLOS ONE, also found those who had attended a meditation retreat, those who only practiced deconstructive types of meditation, such as Vipassana (insight) and Koan practice (used in Zen Buddhism), and those with higher levels of repetitive negative thinking, were more likely to report a 'particularly unpleasant' meditation-related experience.However, the study, which comprised an international online survey of 1,232 people who had at least two months' meditation experience, found female participants and those with a religious belief were less likely to have had a 'particularly unpleasant' experience.The study, conducted with researchers at Witten/Herdecke University, Germany, and the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, was triggered by a limited but growing number of research reports and case studies, which indicate psychologically unpleasant experiences can occur during meditative practice. Some traditional Buddhist texts also reference vivid accounts of similar experiences.However, very little is known about the prevalence of these experiences.Meditators also reported how long they had been practicing meditation and the frequency of practice, whether they had attended a meditation retreat at any point in their life and what form of meditation they practiced (attentional, constructive, or deconstructive). They also completed measures of repetitive negative thinking and self-compassion.",

      "detailedNews": "If Naomi Osaka had been allowed to talk to her coach after going down a set and a break against Victoria Azarenka, what would she have been told by him? Probably something generic like, “Be more aggressive” or “Change things up”. That’s what most coaches say when tasked with helping their charge out of a hole, and what most players think they want to hear.Fortunately for Osaka, the Grand Slams don’t permit on-court coaching. I say ‘fortunately’, because she didn’t change much or try to be more aggressive despite being in a seemingly hopeless situation against an in-form opponent. Instead, she just trusted her instincts and stuck to her strengths.Osaka’s struggles since winning the Australian Open earlier this year have been well-documented. A much-publicised split with coach Sascha Bajin was followed by a string of early losses. When she entered the clay swing — her least favorite part of the year by far — not many expected her to do much damage.But as unfavorable as clay is to Osaka’s game, she showed definite signs of progress in the events leading up to Roland Garros. A semi-final finish in Stuttgart was followed by twin quarter-final appearances in Madrid and Rome. She wasn’t being a world-beater on clay, but she was certainly being competitive.Against Azarenka in the second round, Osaka still betrayed a few signs of discomfort on the slow surface. She didn’t slide nearly as well as traditional claycourters do, she didn’t try too many variations to make her opponent move up and down the court, and she didn’t take much pace off her first serve even when her second delivery was getting pummelled. Most damningly, she didn’t try putting more spin on her crosscourt forehand when pushed wide, and that was exposed to perfection by Azarenka over the first set and a half.",
